A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

1. Tab Navigation
The app has four tabs: Project, Saved, Shared, and Achievement.
2. Search Bar
A TextField search bar is included on the Project tab to allow users to quickly search for projects by title.
As you type in the search bar, the list of projects dynamically filters to show only matching items.
3. Filter Button
A floating action button labeled "Filter" is located at the bottom center of the screen..
4. Project Cards
Each project is represented as a card with:
A thumbnail image on the left side.
Project title, language, author, and grade information.
A small badge displaying a grade or label (e.g., "A") with a gradient background.
5. Dynamic Filtering
Projects are stored in a list and dynamically filtered based on the input in the search bar.
The app only displays projects that match the entered search text, enhancing the user experience.
